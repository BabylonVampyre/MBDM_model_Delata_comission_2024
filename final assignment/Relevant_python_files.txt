Python files and notebooks:
Robustness_Evaluation.ipynb: contians filtering of candidate policies and used to calculate and analyse robustness metrics for policies.
Robustness_Evaluation.py: used for the generation of data when re-evaluating the selected policies under multiple scenarios. The data generated here is used in Robustness_evaluation.ipynb.
Robustness.ipynb: calculates and evaluates convergence from directed search policy design
dike_model_optimization-for-directed-search.py: used to conduct MOEA and generate candidate policy solutions.
Sobol Analysis.ipynb: contains code that analyses Sobol results
GSA_sobol - Copy.py: used to conduct and generate data for Sobol analysis using sobol uncertainty sampling.
Problem Formulations.ipynb: original problem formulation notebook given in the final assignment folder.
FeatureScoring.ipynb: used to geenrate the heatmaps for the final GSA that is in report appendix.

Folders:
data: came with final assignment files.
directed search results: contains all results from directed search method
robustness_final: contains plots and policies used in robustness evaluation
sobol_plots: contains plots from intiial sobol analysis
results: contains data generated for initial sobol analysis
